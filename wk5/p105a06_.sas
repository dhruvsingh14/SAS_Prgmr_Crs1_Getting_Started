*    1) Add options to include N (count), MEAN, and MIN   *;
*       statistics. Round each statistic to the nearest   *;
*       integer.                                          *;
*    2) Add a CLASS statement to group the data by Season *;
*       and Ocean. Run the program.                       *;
*    3) Modify the program to add the WAYS statement so   *;
*       that separate reports are created for Season and  *;
*       Ocean statistics. Run the program.                *;
*       Which ocean had the lowest mean for minimum       *;
*       pressure?                                         *;
*       Which season had the lowest mean for minimum      *;
*       pressure?                                         *;
